The Perl 6 community has basically broken down into warring camps with a tremendous amount of vitriol and "not invented here" and while I still strongly believe that something like Perl 6 Regexes will eventually be the way every language treats parsing, I think it needs to grow out of a different community at this point.

## Gen6 Regex

A Perl 6 Regex minimal, language-neutral specification for other languages.

* The ["Your Regex Here"](YOUR-REGEX-HERE-POSTING.md) announcement and high-
  level overview.
* The [reference grammar](regex) that (under a conforming implementation)
  parses itself.
* The [test tool for the reference grammar](regex.t6) written in Perl 6.
  Run it with `--help` for full command-line info.
